			It's 3am, you're gaming with your friends and someone on the other team is being toxic and 
            all of a sudden says “[Your gamertag], I have your ip. Prepare to be booted!”. You believe that they are bluffing. 
            10 seconds pass. 20 seconds pass. You figure out that they are bluffing but you see that your teammate has been disconnected! 
            They got the wrong IP!

			How would you check to see your IP on your machine (Windows)?

			The flag is in the format COMMAND
