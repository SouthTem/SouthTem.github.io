			You just got out of your 11:30am class and your 1pm class was just canceled. 
			With no class until 4pm you decide to eat lunch by the library pond. A charm 
			of sparrows land on the railing, you think they are trying to tell you something.
		</p>
		<p>
			What are the birds trying to tell you?<br>
			hint: birds on a wire cipher
